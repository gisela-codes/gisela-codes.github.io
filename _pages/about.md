I am a senior Software Engineering student and web designer at Utah Tech University in St. George, Utah. I’m currently a research assistant developing a mobile app and machine learning models to interface with a metabolic analyzer mask designed by my research group.

**Research Interests**

Projects that bridge software, hardware, and real-world data, particularly in areas such as:
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Embedded Systems and IoT
- Biomedical engineering

## Background
I’m a first-generation Salvadoran American and the oldest of four siblings. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, paddleboarding, and weightlifting. I grew up in Provo, Utah and moved to southern Utah for the warmer weather and outdoor lifestyle. 

## Long Term goals
- Pursue a master’s degree in Computer Science or Electrical & Computer Engineering
- Gain industry experience and eventually become an educator
